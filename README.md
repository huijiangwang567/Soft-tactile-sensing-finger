# Soft-tactile-sensing-finger
We demonstrate the development of a recurrent neural network-based closed-loop force controller for a soft finger equipped with embedded soft sensors. This repository contains materials and code for a tutorial on developing machine learning (ML)-based controllers for soft robots with embedded sensors. The tutorial is designed to be accessible to individuals with little to no prior experience in robotics or robot control.

## Overview

Developing feedback controllers for robots with embedded sensors is traditionally a challenging task that requires expert knowledge. However, with the rise of ML, creating learning-based controllers has become more accessible. This tutorial introduces participants to ML-based sensing and control in cyber-physical systems using a soft robotic device.

In this tutorial, you will learn how to create a recurrent neural network (RNN)-based closed-loop force controller for a soft finger equipped with embedded soft sensors. The tutorial was validated in a 2.5-hour workshop with students who had no prior knowledge of robot control, demonstrating its accessibility and effectiveness.

## Tutorial Structure

The tutorial is divided into the following sections:

1. **Introduction to Soft Robotics**: Overview of soft robotic systems and their applications.
2. **Tactile Sensing with Soft Sensors**: Explanation of how embedded sensors work in soft robotic fingers.
3. **Simulation of the tactile sensing modality**: Virtual simulation of a tactile sensing finger using the strain sensors in fingertip contacts.
4. **Developing a Force Controller**: Step-by-step guide to creating an RNN-based closed-loop force controller.
5. **Testing and Validation**: Methods for evaluating the performance of your controller.
